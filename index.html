               <h2>Early Life</h2>
               <p>
                  I have always enjoyed making doing creative things like art and solving problems.  When I was a kid I loved <a href="https://timconceivable.tumblr.com/post/2678184385/lego-cloud-venom" target="_blank">building things with Lego blocks</a>, taking things apart to see how they worked, and playing puzzle games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myst" target="_blank">Myst</a>.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I also remember trying to follow instructions from a kids' magazine to make some very simple text adventure games with Visual Basic at one point, but text adventures weren't as interesting to me as contemporary graphical video games, and I guess coding never interested me as much as art did.

               <h2>A Career</h2>
               <p>
                  For decades I wanted to make art my career, but wasn't sure how to do that.  I wanted to make comics working for Marvel or be an animator at Disney or something; but I always struggled when given an art assignment or when money was involved.  After many many years I've decided that maybe it is better to keep art as a hobby just for my own enjoyment.
               </p>
               <p>
                  It wasn't until around 2010 when I found a game development meetup group that it occurred to me that making video games was a thing I could do.  My first experience working on games was making art during game jams.  I collaborated with programmers, writers, and musicians on several tiny games made in just a weekend.  It was a lot of fun, and I was making art!

                  Eventually, I got curious about coding games myself and started exploring that with a game engine called GameMaker. GameMaker has a visual code-block method to program games but also it's own coding language.  I <a href="https://timconceivable.tumblr.com/post/11339668234/ghost-world-game" target="_blank">started out</a> using the code blocks, but quickly found there were limits to what could be done with them.  So little by little I learned actual code as my game aspirations got more ambitious.

               <h2>LaunchCode</h2>
               <p> 
                  Despite coding games for a few years, I still felt like I didn't really know how to code properly.  A few of my game dev friends suggested I should take a LaunchCode course and finally in 2018 I did.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I learned <a href="https://github.com/timconceivable?tab=overview&from=2018-03-01&to=2018-03-31" target="_blank">Python and C# web development skills</a> and graduated from the LC101 course, but still felt like an imposter and wasn't sure if I was ready for a coding career or if it was really something I wanted to do.  So I let 5 years slip by before deciding to take LaunchCode's course again to brush up on my coding knowledge and finally commit to starting a career in code.
               </p>
               <p>
                  This time I'm learning Javascript (with Node and React) and Java web development.  Besides the new languages, there are quite a few differences between this course and the previous one.  I'm already feeling more confident as a programmer and excited to start a career in web dev!  I'm definitely not going to stop making games, but it will continue to be a hobby for me.
